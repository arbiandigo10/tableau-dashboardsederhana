# Project build simple dashboard visualization using Tableau

## Description
A sales dashboard to analyze key business metrics, including total sales, profit, customer count, sales by month, product performance, and geographic distribution of sales across states. Created to assist stakeholders in tracking business performance and identifying improvement opportunities.

## Goals
- Provide a high-level overview of sales performance.
- Identify top-performing products and regions.
- Highlight trends in monthly sales to guide planning and strategy.
- Enable actionable insights for sales growth and profitability improvement.

## Dependencies
- Python (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data preparation and visualization)
- Tableau/Power BI (for building the dashboard interface)
- Data source: CSV/Excel file containing sales, profit, customer, and product-related data
- GIS library (if the map visualization requires additional geographic insights)

## Insights
- Sales Growth: There is a steady increase in sales from January to November, with a significant spike in November, suggesting a peak sales period (possibly due to seasonal promotions).
- Product Performance: Phones, chairs, and tables are the top three products driving revenue, indicating their importance to overall sales.
- Geographic Analysis: Sales are concentrated in a few states, with darker shades indicating higher sales, allowing targeted marketing or expansion strategies.
- Profitability: Despite high sales, the profit margin seems moderate, hinting at potential cost optimization areas.

## Advice
- Focus on Key Products: Invest in promoting high-performing products like phones and chairs while analyzing underperforming categories for potential improvements.
- Prepare for Seasonal Trends: Leverage the November sales spike by running seasonal marketing campaigns earlier to maximize revenue.
- Expand in High-Potential States: Allocate resources to regions with lower sales to increase penetration while maintaining strongholds in top-performing areas.
- Improve Profit Margins: Analyze operational costs and pricing strategies to enhance profit without compromising sales volume.
